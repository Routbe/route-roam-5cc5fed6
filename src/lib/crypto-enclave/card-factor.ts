/**
 * ROUT Card recovery factor (nfc_card, ceremony versions 2 and 3).
 *
 * Split knowledge: the card's NDEF tap URL carries, after its SUN part, a
 * fragment `#rk1=<43 base64url chars>` holding 32 random bytes written at
 * personalisation and never stored by ROUT. Browsers never send a fragment to
 * a server (neither Web NFC on Android nor Safari opening /t on iPhone), so the
 * factor key below can only be derived on a device that has just read the
 * card. The SUN part (PICCData + CMAC) stays the server's live-tap proof; the
 * server can verify taps but can never derive this factor, so ROUT's own
 * factor plus the card gate never add up to two shares (and 3 are needed).
 *
 * The fragment secret is held in a fresh buffer the caller must wipe; the
 * returned keys' `secretKey` is the caller's to wipe too.
