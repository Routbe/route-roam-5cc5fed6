/**
 * Pure rules for step-up re-verification on sensitive actions.

 * SMS, recovery code, password), but never e-mail, and only after 2FA is on.
 * A tap of the member's own physical ROUT Card ("card", db/0250) counts like an
 * authenticator app: card actions and general sensitive actions, never a vault
 * read or a card scan. Only the server grants it, after a verified, owner-checked tap.
